## Overview

Place notes at your current location, and see other's notes in the same area (posted from any time in the past). The most popular notes in an area become Treasure. Usually, notes can't be seen unless you're within around 200 meters of them, but a Treasure is visible from further and further out the more popular it becomes. This app is hyper-local - so you can share your adventures through location rather than time, and so it leads you on an adventure discovering Treasure after Treasure!

## Features

#### Posting Notes
Anywhere you are, you can place a note at your exact coordinates. 

#### Viewing Notes
You can also view notes sorted by distance, popularity, and both. Notes can be viewed in map form.

#### Note Sorting
Notes have an upvoting and flagging system.

#### Treasure
A note that is popular enough becomes Treasure. Treasure will be specially sorted. Treasure creation and viewing should be special and visually pleasing.

# Push Notifications
Each note has a range where it can result in a push notification, dependent on its own popularity and the note density (number of surrounding notes).
