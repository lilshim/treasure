## Summary

Geocache notes for others. The best notes become Treasure!

## Features

# Posting Notes
Anywhere you are, you can place a note at your exact coordinates. 

# Viewing Notes
You can also view notes sorted by distance, popularity, and both. Notes can be viewed in map form.

# Note Sorting
Notes have an upvoting and flagging system.

# Treasure
A note that is popular enough becomes Treasure. Treasure will be specially sorted. Treasure creation and viewing should be special and visually pleasing.

# Push Notifications
Each note has a range where it can result in a push notification, dependent on its own popularity and the note density (number of surrounding notes).
